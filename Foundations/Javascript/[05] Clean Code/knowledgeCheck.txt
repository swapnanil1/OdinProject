*** Why is it important to write clean code?
Most of a developer's time is spent on reading code rather than writing. Writing Clean Code help with that.
It helps for other developers to under your code faster and in a more efficient manner.
It helps us as we as human often forget thing so checking in code writen a month back will make more sense!.

*** What are some good principles for keeping code clean?
1. Revise Your Logic Before Coding
2. Clearly Expose the Structure of the Page 
3. Use the Correct Indentation | use extensions to do so
4. Write Explanatory Comments | helpfull for writing documentaion 
5. Avoid Abusing Comments
6. Avoid Extremely Large Functions | Break up large functions into smaller ones
7. Use Naming Standards for Functions and Variables | use of camelCase , UPPERCASE for const are few examples
8. Treat Changes with Caution
9. Avoid Indiscriminate Mixing of Coding Languages
10. Summarize Your Imports

*** What is the difference between good comments and bad comments?
Good Comments 
Only add comment when necessory to explain something . often writing clean code we try to make the code self-explanatory.
Keeping the correct indentations
Respecting standards in use. To use the same coding practices inside the organization . This makes reading your colleague code easier and faster

Bad Comment 
Disrepect someone on an issue . 
Not fixing something and saying someone else will do it.

*** Some good things to keep in mind while naming variables & functions :-
Always try start a FUNCTION name using a verb | This helps to know what the fn does .
->For example 
function getUserScore();
or 
fetchPlayerName();
or 
function retrievePlayer1Tag();

Always try start a VARIABLE name using a noun/adjective | This helps to know what the variable stores.
-> For exmaple
const numberOfThings = 10;
const myName = "Thor";
const selected = true;
