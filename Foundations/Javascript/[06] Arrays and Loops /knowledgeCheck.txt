How to Create an Array in JavaScript
const myArray = ["Cat", "Dogs", "Goat"];

Did you know that in JavaScript, an array is actually a type of object?
Cool Things You Can Do with Arrays

1. Find Out How Long an Array Is
myArray.length will tell you how many items are in the array.

2. Convert an Array to a String
myArray.toString() will turn the array into a string, with each item separated by commas.

3. Get a Specific Item from an Array
myArray.at(1) will give you the item at the 1st position (remember, counting starts from 0!).

4. Join All Items into a Single String
myArray.join() will combine all the items into a single string, with commas in between. But, you can also add your own separator, like this: myArray.join(" - ").

5. Remove the Last Item
myArray.pop() will delete the last item from the array.

6. Add a New Item to the End
myArray.push("Horse") will add a new item to the end of the array.

7. Remove the First Item
myArray.shift() will delete the first item from the array and move all the other items down.

8. Add a New Item to the Beginning
myArray.unshift("Tiger") will add a new item to the beginning of the array and move all the other items up.

9. Delete an Item at a Specific Position
myArray.delete(1) will delete the item at the 1st position, but be careful, as this can leave "holes" in the array. It's better to use pop() or shift() instead.

10. Combine Two Arrays
myArray.concat(anotherArray) will create a new array by combining two existing arrays.

11. Copy Items from One Array to Another
myArray.copyWithin(2, 4) will copy items from the 4th position to the 2nd position in the array.

12. Flatten a Multi-Dimensional Array
myArray.flat() will turn a multi-dimensional array into a single, flat array.

13. Add, Remove, or Replace Items
myArray.splice(1, 2, "New Item") can do three things: remove items, replace items, or add new items to the array.

14. Create a New Array with Sliced Items
myArray.slice(1, 3) will create a new array with items from the 1st to the 3rd position (exclusive).
